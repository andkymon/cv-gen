# CVGen

**CVGen** is my very first project built with **React**!  
I created it to practice handling **state** and **props**â€”two core concepts in React development.

## ðŸš§ Project Status: In Progress

This app is still under development! Here are a few features I'm planning to add:

- [ ] Export CV as PDF
- [ ] Add more sections (e.g., skills, certifications)
- [ ] Support for multiple entries in education and work experience
- [ ] Page breaks for better layout when content overflows

# CVGen

CVGen is my very first project built with **React**!  
I made it to practice managing **state** and **props**, which are core concepts in React development.

**Still a work in progress!**  
Features and improvements I'm planning to add:

- [ ] Download button to export the CV as a PDF
- [ ] Additional sections (e.g. skills, certifications)
- [ ] Support for multiple education and work experience entries
- [ ] Page breaks when content overflows
